                <h2>A Leadership Moment in a Complex System</h2>

                <p>
                    In early 2024, I stepped into my first people-management role at <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, transitioning from an individual contributor position into a space that had experienced frequent leadership turnover.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Taking responsibility for the five-person UX team supporting the Build &amp; Release area of the Engineering Portal came with challenges often seen in large organizations undergoing change:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A distributed team of early-career designers and researchers with growing domain knowledge, but limited experience operating as a coordinated team within a large, multi-stakeholder environment</li>
                    <li>A complex product space with a fragmented experience shaped by multiple owners</li>
                    <li>Evolving expectations around UX’s role within a PM-centric operating model</li>
                    <li>Ongoing misalignment across Product and Engineering teams that impacted planning and delivery</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    These conditions were not unique, but they required intentional design leadership. My focus became identifying high-leverage interventions that could improve alignment, visibility, and product coherence—without disrupting delivery.
                </p>

                </figure>
            </section>

            <!-- ====================== 2) APPROACH ====================== -->
            <section id="approach">
                <div class="section-label">2. Strategic approach</div>
                <h2>Designing the Conditions for Impact</h2>

                <p>
                    Rather than addressing individual symptoms in isolation, I focused on designing the conditions that would allow both the team and the product to progress together.
                </p>

                <p>My approach centered on three deliberate choices:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Establish a shared operating rhythm.</strong> Create clarity around priorities, sequencing, and ownership—without adding unnecessary process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Make work visible and collaborative.</strong> Shift UX engagement from reactive support to active partnership across Product and Engineering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hold a coherent product vision while expanding authorship.</strong> Make space for contributions while ensuring the experience evolved as a system.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Importantly, these choices were as much about what I avoided—heavy governance, disruptive structural change—as what I introduced: small, high-leverage interventions that could scale through practice.
                </p>

                <div class="pull">
                    <blockquote>“Structure was never the goal; it was the scaffolding that made flexibility possible.”</blockquote>

            <section id="execution">
                <div class="section-label">3. Execution</div>
                <h2>Turning Strategy into Practice</h2>

                <p>
                    With a clear strategic direction in place, the focus shifted to translating intent into consistent, observable practice. I established a predictable weekly cadence that balanced focus, learning, and visibility—allowing the team to build new habits incrementally
                    while continuing to deliver.
                </p>

                <div class="callout callout-accent">
                    <h3>One-week cadence (overview)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> intentionally scoped work aligned to capacity</li>
                        <li><strong>Learning:</strong> domain knowledge and rationale embedded into delivery</li>
                        <li><strong>Checkpoint:</strong> early visibility into progress, risks, and dependencies</li>
                        <li><strong>Demo:</strong> work shared, connected to the broader experience, and later extended to stakeholders</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="section-label">4. Product impact</div>
                <h2>From Fragmentation to Coherence</h2>

                <p>
                    As the team developed a shared rhythm and clearer operating model, space opened to address the Build &amp; Release experience more holistically. The product could be approached not as isolated surfaces, but as an end-to-end system—with clearer relationships
                    between tools, stages, and user actions.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <div class="figure-card">
                        <div class="placeholder">Visual Placeholder — End-to-end Pipeline Flow</div>

                </figure>

                <p>
                    The resulting designs emphasized clearer sequencing, more consistent interaction patterns, and reduced cognitive load. The experience became calmer—not because it was simplified, but because it was better aligned.
                </p>

                    <div class="figure-card">

                        Suggested visual: one representative screen or prototype step with brief callouts for clarity and reduced cognitive load.

                <div class="section-label">5. Reflection</div>
                <h2>Designing at Multiple Levels</h2>

                <p>
                    This experience reinforced a belief I have carried throughout my career: strong design is not defined by control, but by clarity, care, and intention. Stepping into people leadership did not pull me away from product work—it expanded the surface on which
                    design decisions mattered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Enabling an early-career team to do their best work required designing the conditions in which good decisions could emerge consistently, without constant intervention: introducing structure early and loosening it deliberately, holding a clear product
                    vision while making space for contributions, and knowing when to step in as a designer and when to step back as a leader.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I remain deeply motivated by complex product challenges. What this experience added is a stronger appreciation for how team dynamics, operating models, and design craft are inseparable at scale.
