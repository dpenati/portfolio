                <p>
                    In early 2024, I stepped into my first people-management role at <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, transitioning from an individual contributor position into a space that had experienced frequent leadership turnover.

                    Taking responsibility for the five-person UX team supporting the Build &amp; Release area of the Engineering Portal came with challenges often seen in large organizations undergoing change:

            <p>
            Rather than treating symptoms in isolation, I focused on designing the conditions that enabled
            <strong>designers, engineers, and product partners</strong> to move forward with shared clarity and momentum.

                These choices were intentional not only in what they addressed, but in what they avoided: large reorganizations, heavy governance, or disruptive structural changes.

                <p>
                    With a clear strategic direction in place, the focus shifted to translating intent into consistent, observable practice. I established a predictable weekly cadence that balanced focus, learning, and visibility—allowing the team to build new habits incrementally

                <h2>From Fragmentation to Coherence</h2>

                <p>
                    As the team developed a shared rhythm and clearer operating model, space opened to address the Build &amp; Release experience more holistically. The product could be approached not as isolated surfaces, but as an end-to-end system—with clearer relationships
                    between tools, stages, and user actions.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <div class="figure-card">
                        <div class="placeholder">Visual Placeholder — End-to-end Pipeline Flow</div>

                <p>
                    The resulting designs emphasized clearer sequencing, more consistent interaction patterns, and reduced cognitive load. The experience became calmer—not because it was simplified, but because it was better aligned.

                <h2>Designing at Multiple Levels</h2>

                <p>
                    This experience reinforced a belief I have carried throughout my career: strong design is not defined by control, but by clarity, care, and intention. Stepping into people leadership did not pull me away from product work—it expanded the surface on which
                    design decisions mattered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Enabling an early-career team to do their best work required designing the conditions in which good decisions could emerge consistently, without constant intervention: introducing structure early and loosening it deliberately, holding a clear product
                    vision while making space for contributions, and knowing when to step in as a designer and when to step back as a leader.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I remain deeply motivated by complex product challenges. What this experience added is a stronger appreciation for how team dynamics, operating models, and design craft are inseparable at scale.
